# Better Control over CodeIgniter Tables

My CodeIgniter Table Library (MY_Table) is an extended CI_Table class to use in your CodeIgniter applications. It provides more control over auto-generated tables when pulling records from database objects, offering actions to be performed per-field (column), and allows limiting of these actions via 'where' clauses to specific rows of data.

## Current Features

- Very flexible table setup and population from database objects
- Easy configuration/renaming of table headers
- Add extra table headers
- Example CRUD system

## Road Map

Current road-map is to get this system documented and available via GitHub.

## Lend A Hand

If you're interested in helping out, fork the GitHub project and start coding! I'd love to have you on board. You can always shoot me an email at github@harpanet.com and we can talk about what you'd like to do.

It's just little ole' me
